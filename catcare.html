            Caring for a cat involves providing them with a safe and comfortable environment while meeting their physical and emotional needs. Here are some general instructions for cat care:

            <li>
                <strong>Nutrition:</strong> Feed your cat a balanced diet formulated for their age, activity level, and health status. Ensure access to fresh water at all times and monitor their food intake to prevent obesity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Litter Box:</strong> Keep your cat's litter box clean and odor-free by scooping waste daily and replacing litter regularly. Provide multiple litter boxes in different locations for multi-cat households.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scratching Posts:</strong> Cats have a natural instinct to scratch, which helps them maintain healthy claws and stretch their muscles. Provide scratching posts or pads to satisfy this behavior and protect your furniture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enrichment:</strong> Keep your cat mentally stimulated by providing toys, climbing structures, and interactive play sessions. Rotate toys regularly to prevent boredom and encourage exploration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Healthcare:</strong> Schedule regular veterinary check-ups for your cat, including vaccinations, parasite control, and dental care. Monitor your cat's weight, appetite, and behavior for any signs of illness or distress.
